They are believed to have featured autonomous constitutions but the same currency. Amorgos is distinguished by the size and quality of the walls surrounding the city of Arkesini, by the ancient towers whose remains are scattered all over the island, by the ancient tombs, the stone tools, the inscriptions, the vases and by other antiquities.</p>

The natural beauty of Samothrace is also worth mentioning. Many streams(the main is the river Fonias which means murderer) flow from mount Saos through the forest all the way to the sea, forming on their way waterfalls and stone basins, also called as "vathres". The wild scenery continues throughout the whole island. The beaches are pebbled with crystal waters.
